Sorry I have been busy with life. Updates have been terribly slow(the last update was nearly a year ago!) but I will try to work on this whenever I can. I started off this project while in school and I currently hold a full time job, it's hard to juggle between work, life commitments and this project. 


So what has changed?

- Fixed security settings for Android 10. #224
- Fixed bug where changing date time setting will crash
- Updated new app icon! (@ArnyminerZ)
- Fixed bug where clicking on budget screen will crash on certain version of Firefly III
- User's local time will now be shown when clicking on the time field when adding a new transaction
- Update target and compile SDK to 33
- Update Android gradle plugin to 7.4.0
- Update gradle wrapper to 7.5
